/* #LOGIC
The Fibonacci series follows a simple pattern:

1. Start with two numbers: 0 and 1.
2. The next number is found by adding the previous two numbers.
3. Keep repeating this process to get the next numbers in the series.

For example:
- Start with 0, 1.
- Next number: 0 + 1 = 1, so the series is now 0, 1, 1.
- Next: 1 + 1 = 2, so 0, 1, 1, 2.
- Next: 1 + 2 = 3, so 0, 1, 1, 2, 3.
- Next: 2 + 3 = 5, so 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.
- And so on...

This pattern continues forever! ðŸ˜Š*/
